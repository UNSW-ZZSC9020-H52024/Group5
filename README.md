### Brief project description

This project aims to develop a robust energy demand forecasting model specifically for New South Wales (NSW), leveraging machine learning techniques and comprehensive data analysis. By integrating weather patterns, climate change impacts, air quality data, and population projections, the project seeks to accurately predict energy consumption in NSW. Through the application of advanced models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks, the project will explore the intricate relationships between environmental variables and energy demand. The outcome will provide valuable insights for energy suppliers, enabling more efficient energy production, distribution, and long-term planning in response to evolving climate conditions and demographic changes in NSW.
